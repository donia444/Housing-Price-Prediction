# Housing-Price-Prediction
# 🏠 Housing Price Prediction & Market Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project builds a Machine Learning model to predict housing prices based on property features (Location, Median Income, Number of Rooms). It emphasizes **Data Cleaning** and **Correlation Analysis** to understand what drives real estate value.

**Key Objectives:**
1.  **Data Cleaning:** identifying and removing outliers and filling missing housing data.
2.  **Correlation Analysis:** Using Heatmaps to find strong relationships between median income and house value.
3.  **Predictive Modeling:** Training a Regression model to predict property prices with high accuracy.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Core:** Python, Pandas, NumPy
* **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn (Correlation Heatmaps, Scatter Plots)
* **ML Models:** Scikit-Learn (Linear Regression, Decision Trees)

## 📊 Methodology
* **Data Preprocessing:** Standardized numerical features and handled missing entries in the dataset.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    * Visualized the geographical distribution of housing prices.
    * Identified that **Median Income** is the strongest predictor of house prices.
* **Model Evaluation:** Evaluated performance using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to ensure reliable price estimates.
